    Given The evaluation concept is "MA, MPA, MANA" with concepts "MA", "MPA", "MANA"
    When I update the "MA, MPA, MANA" concept to "Usual Average" concept
    Then The evaluation concept "Usual Average" is set

  #Controller Scenario
  Scenario: Configure the atual evaluation concept with invalid attributes.
    Given The evaluation concept is "MA, MPA, MANA" with concepts "MA", "MPA", "MANA"
    When I update the "MA, MPA, MANA" concept to "New Concept" evaluation concept with no concepts
    Then The atual concept is "MA, MPA, MANA"

  #GUI Scenario
