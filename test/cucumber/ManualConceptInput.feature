Feature: Manual Concept Input
  As a professor
  I want to input concepts manually
  So I can input them from written evaluations

#Controller Scenario
  @ignore
  Scenario: Spreadsheet with at least one student and one criterion
    Given that the spreadsheet contains at least one student and one criterion
    When the user input manually a new concept "MA" with a description "Questão 1 da Prova 1" into the cell "B2"
    Then the final criterion concept is updated in the system

#Controller Scenario
  @ignore
  Scenario: Spreadsheet without students and at least one criterion
    Given that the spreadsheet does not contain students
    And there is at least one criterion
    When the user try to input manually a new concept "MA" with a description "Questão 1 da Prova 1" into the cell "B2"
    Then the system returns a exception

#GUI Scenario
  @ignore
  Scenario: Spreadsheet with at least one student and one criterion
    Given that I am on the Manual Concept Input page
    And there are at least one student and one criterion on the spreadsheet
    When I choose the cell "B2"
    And I fill it with a new concept "MA" with a description "Questão 1 da Prova 1"
    And I click the button to confirm the operation
    Then the final concept in that criterion is updated

#GUI Scenario
  @ignore
  Scenario: Spreadsheet without students and at least one criterion
    Given that I am on the Manual Concept Input page
    And there are no students
    And there is at least one criterion
    When I try to choose the cell "B2"
    Then the page displays a error message.
